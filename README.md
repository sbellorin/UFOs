UFO Sightings with JavaScript

## Purpose
1. Explain the strengths and weaknesses of JavaScript "standard" and JavaScript version ES6+.
2. Describe JavaScript syntax and ideal use cases.
3. Build and deploy JavaScript functions, including built-in functions.
4. Convert JavaScript functions to arrow functions.
5. Build and deploy forEach (JavaScript for loop).
6. Create, populate, and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript and HTML

## Overview 
The request from a client was to display a table organizing UFO data stored as a JavaScript array. The client wanted the ability to filter by multiple criteria creating a dynamic website.  The table was created using JavaScript, while HTML/CSS and Bootstrap were used to modify the aesthetics of the website. 

## Results:
### Welcome to UFO Sightings!
